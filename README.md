# CFX/FiveM: PRGears (fork of [HugoSimoes12345/HRSGears](https://github.com/HugoSimoes12345/HRSGears) manual gearbox)
To install, download and import this repository to your `resources` folder,
then add `ensure PRGears` to your `server.cfg`.

This resource depends on [PRKeybinds](https://github.com/PyroRitorno/PRKeybinds) to handle the gearbox controls.

It also uses [ESX](https://github.com/esx-framework) for notifications, but those can be removed from the resource manifest and client script.

This fork calculates gear ratios using some random formula that I made with pre-defined variables and certain vehicle properties.
It uses the vehicle's engine upgrade level and number of gears (transmission upgrades add 1 gear).

I'm certain there will be incompatibilities with certain cars/tunings, so feel free to edit the script however you see fit!
